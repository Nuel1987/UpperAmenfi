        <p><em>HISTORY</em></p>
      <p>Upper Amenfi Rural Bank Ltd started as  an Agency   of Amefiman Rural Bank Ltd in 1982.   The aim then was to mobilize   shares and deposits for the headquarters at  Wassa Akropong.<br>
        In August, 1987, the founding fathers of  this bank decided to break   away from Amenfiman Rural Bank Ltd to form a new one  at Ankwawso.  The   main objective was to  mobilize deposit and cultivate the habbit of   savings in the people of the  catchment area.  Ankwawso was chosen as    the head quarters of the bank due to it strategic position as the   central point  for people from the Denkyira, Sefwi  and  Wassa Areas.<br>
        Another objective of the bank was also  to assist farmers to clear their   Akuafo Cheques which had been introduced in  the country for the first   time.</p>
      <p><strong><u>FOUNDING  FATHERS</u></strong><br>
        The main architects of the bank were  Nana Kwadwo Nuamah II,  Chief of   Wassa  Ankaasie, Lawyer Ohene Kofi Duah, both of blessed memory,  Nana   Kofi Boakye I, Chief of Ankwawso.</p>
      <p><strong><u>PROMOTERS</u></strong><br>
        The key promoters of the bank who  assisted to mobilize shares for   the start of the bank were the Late Mr. Amos  Tano, Mr. James Acquah,   Nana Amano, Mr. Kwabena Sonful, and Opanin Kwaku Moses.<br>
        These people travelled the length and breadth  of the bank’s   catchment areas mostly on foot to convince people to purchase  shares.</p>
      <p><strong><u>PERFORMANCE</u></strong><br>
        The Bank performed very well in the  initial stages of its   establishment, between 1990 to 1995.  This was due to the boom in the   cocoa  industry and the emphases placed on Akuafo Cheques purchases.<br>
        During this period, the use of Akuafo  Cheques in the purchase of cocoa   beans<br>
        became mandatory for all cocoa buying  companies, and since the bank    became the  sole agent in this exercise,  the bank  earned a lot of   income  from Akuafo Cheques  Commission.  Most of the Agencies of the    bank were located in farming communities such as Nkronua, Ntom,   Mpatasie,  Adjakaa Manso and Agona Amenfi .<br>
        The bank was then rated among the  satisfactory banks in the country.<br>
        However, in the mid- 1990’s the bank  started to face some set backs.    This was  due partly to mismanagement and partly to the collapse the   Akuafo cheques  system.  With the liberalization of the  Cocoa Marketing   System, and the proliferation of Cocoa buying companies, many  of those   companies started cash purchases of cocoa instead of resorting to the   use  of Akuafo  cheques.  And because the management of the bank failed    to undertake any serious commercial   banking,  the fortunes of the   bank  started to decline.<br>
        During this period, the bank changed  four managers within a period of 4   years (1994 – 1998).</p>
      <p>From 1998, the Management of the bank decided to    open up and entered into  serious deposit mobilization through susu and    micro-finance operations. </p>
      <p>Credit officers were appointed to handle  the   micro finance  business and this  replaced  Akuafo Cheque commission as a    major source of income for the bank.  A  loan of GH¢5,000 (old fifty   Million Cedis) granted to the bank by the  ARB/Danida Project enabled   the bank to  organise micro –finance  groups first in Sefwi Humjibre and   later at  Sefwi Bekwai.  An Agency was established  at Sefwi Bekwai in   2002 and Sefwi Dwenase in 2005. <br>
        With these two agencies, the bank  was able to venture into   commercial banking  and further  expanded its micro-finance  operation.<br>
        As at today, the bank has 8 agencies  located at Ankwawso, Diaso,   Dunkwa, Sefwi Bekwai, Sefwi Dwenase, Sefwi Wiawso  (Watico Campus) Sefwi   Akontombra and   Agona Amenfi.</p>
      <p>.      With a modest profit ofGH¢11,244 in 2002  the bank   has been able to attain a profit of ¢342,000 in 2011, and succeeded in    puting up its head office building and an ultra modern office at Sefwi   Bekwai.  The office building at Agona Amenfi and Sefwi Wiawso (Watico)   are also owned by  the bank.<br>
        Upper Amenfi Rural bank now ranks among  the satisfactory rural   banks in Ghana, and has been a member of Ghana Club 100  for three   consecutive years.<br>
        Upper Amenfi Rural Bank is now 25 years old  and it is the vision   of the Board and Management to be among the leading Rural  Banks in the   country.<br>
        This vision is being pursued to the letter  and the future of the   bank looks bright.</p>
      <p>The bank can become among the 5 leading rural    banks in the country in the very near future with the support and   goodwill of  all stakeholders</p>
