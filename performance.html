      <p class="style10"><strong><u>PERFORMANCE</u></strong><br>
The Bank performed very well in the  initial stages of its establishment, between 1990 to 1995.&nbsp; This was due to the boom in the cocoa  industry and the emphases placed on Akuafo Cheques purchases.<br>
During this period, the use of Akuafo  Cheques in the purchase of cocoa beans<br>
became mandatory for all cocoa buying  companies, and since the bank&nbsp; became the  sole agent in this exercise,&nbsp; the bank  earned a lot of income&nbsp; from Akuafo Cheques  Commission.&nbsp; Most of the Agencies of the  bank were located in farming communities such as Nkronua, Ntom, Mpatasie,  Adjakaa Manso and Agona Amenfi .<br>
The bank was then rated among the  satisfactory banks in the country.<br>
However, in the mid- 1990&rsquo;s the bank  started to face some set backs.&nbsp; This was  due partly to mismanagement and partly to the collapse the Akuafo cheques  system.&nbsp; With the liberalization of the  Cocoa Marketing System, and the proliferation of Cocoa buying companies, many  of those companies started cash purchases of cocoa instead of resorting to the use  of Akuafo &nbsp;cheques.&nbsp; And because the management of the bank failed  to undertake any serious commercial&nbsp;  banking, &nbsp;the fortunes of the bank  started to decline.<br>
During this period, the bank changed  four managers within a period of 4 years (1994 &ndash; 1998).</p>
      <span class="style10">From 1998, the Management of the bank decided to  open up and entered into &nbsp;serious deposit mobilization through susu and  micro-finance operations. </span>
      <p class="style10">Credit officers were appointed to handle  the micro finance&nbsp; business and this  replaced&nbsp; Akuafo Cheque commission as a  major source of income for the bank.&nbsp; A  loan of GH&cent;5,000 (old fifty Million Cedis) granted to the bank by the  ARB/Danida Project enabled the bank to &nbsp;organise micro &ndash;finance&nbsp; groups first in Sefwi Humjibre and later at  Sefwi Bekwai.&nbsp; An Agency was established  at Sefwi Bekwai in 2002 and Sefwi Dwenase in 2005. <br>
  &nbsp;With these two agencies, the bank&nbsp; was able to venture into commercial banking  and further&nbsp; expanded its micro-finance  operation.<br>
        As at today, the bank has 8 agencies  located at Ankwawso, Diaso, Dunkwa, Sefwi Bekwai, Sefwi Dwenase, Sefwi Wiawso  (Watico Campus) Sefwi Akontombra and&nbsp;  Agona Amenfi.<br>
        With a modest profit ofGH&cent;11,244 in 2002  the bank has been able to attain a profit of &cent;342,000 in 2011, and succeeded in  puting up its head office building and an ultra modern office at Sefwi Bekwai.  The office building at Agona Amenfi and Sefwi Wiawso (Watico) are also owned by  the bank.<br>
        Upper Amenfi Rural bank now ranks among  the satisfactory rural banks in Ghana, and has been a member of Ghana Club 100  for three consecutive years.<br>
        Upper Amenfi Rural Bank is now 25 years old  and it is the vision of the Board and Management to be among the leading Rural  Banks in the country.<br>
        This vision is being pursued to the letter  and the future of the bank looks bright.</p>
      <p class="style10">The bank can become among the 5 leading rural  banks in the country in the very near future with the support and goodwill of  all stakeholders.<br>
