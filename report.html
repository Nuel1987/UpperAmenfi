      <p class="style10">23RD ANNUAL REPORT </p>
        <p class="style10">The  Managing Director of ARB Apex Bank Ltd, Kasapreko Kwame Basanyin II, Omanhene  of Wassa Amenfi Traditional Area, Odeneho Gyapong Ababio II, Omanhene of Sefwi  Bekwai Traditional Area, Board Members of Sister Rural and Community Banks,  Fellow Directors, Invited Guests, Nananom, Shareholders, Members of the  Press,&nbsp; distinguished ladies and  gentlemen, it is my pleasure to welcome you to the 23rd &nbsp;Annual General Meeting of Upper Amenfi Rural  Bank Ltd which also happens to be the 25th anniversary of the  bank.&nbsp; I will present to you an overview  of the bank&rsquo;s activities for the year 2011.&nbsp;  Your directors will also present the financial performance of the bank  for the year ended 31st December 2011.<br>
          The  banking industry continued to be competitive in the year under review, with the  proliferation of micro-finance institutions and other financial NGOs operating  all over the country.&nbsp; There is therefore  the need to provide state of the art infrastructure to be able to meet the  competition.&nbsp; The move towards automation  continues, with almost all branches of rural and community  banks in the country fully computerized and net worked.&nbsp; A customer of Upper Amenfi Rural Bank based  at Sefwi Akontombra can now do business with the branch of the bank at Dunkwa  or any other branch. Similarly, a customer of the bank can now transfer money  and cash it at any rural bank almost instantly through Apex Link Money  Transfer, now dubbed itrans.<br>
          Our  bank is now linked to Western Union Money Transfer and Money- gram business  through the power of computers.&nbsp; All  these call for increase in expenditure on equipment and other facilities.<br>
          In  spite of these challenges, the bank continued to make progress in all areas of  its operation.&nbsp; I wish to begin with the  profit for the year 2011.</p>
        <p class="style10"><strong><u>PROFIT</u></strong><br>
The  Bank declared profit before tax of GH&cent;342,037 in 2011 compared with GH&cent;251,089  in 2010.&nbsp; This showed an increase of 36%.&nbsp; The increase in profit came about as a result  of an increase in the volume of operations.</p>
        <p class="style10"><strong><u>ADVANCES</u></strong><br>
          Advances  increased from GH&cent;3,806,460 in 2010 to GH&cent;5,753,215 in 2011, showing an increase  of 51%.&nbsp; The Bank continued to grant  bigger loans to both individuals and groups, and this accounted for the  increase in advances.<br>
          However,  there is still a high rate of default, and this is preventing the bank from  enjoying the full benefits from the increase in loans.</p>
        <p class="style10"><strong><u>DEPOSIT</u></strong><br>
          Total  deposits increased from GH&cent;12,636,062 in 2010 to GH&cent;17,549,548 in 2011, showing  an increase of 39%.&nbsp; Shareholders are  again encouraged to patronize the bank to help move the bank forward.</p>
        <p class="style10"><strong><u>INVESTMENT</u></strong><br>
          The  Bank&rsquo;s short term investment increased from GH&cent;4,411,275 in 2010 to GH&cent;7,078,780  in 2011, this shows an increase of 60% over the previous year&rsquo;s figure.&nbsp; The Bank also invested GH&cent;143,673 in the  shares of the ARB Apex Bank Ltd, as against GH&cent;108,858 in 2010.</p>
        <p class="style10"><strong><u>TOTAL  ASSETS</u></strong><br>
The Total Assets of the bank increased from  GH&cent;15,836,003 in 2010 to GH&cent;19,629,874 in 2011, recording an increase of 24%.</p>
        <p class="style10">This increase is due to the construction works that  took place at the Head Office and Sefwi Bekwai, and the acquisition of other  assets, such as generators and other equipments.</p>
        <p class="style10"><strong><u>SHARE  HOLDERS FUNDS</u></strong><br>
          Shareholders  funds increased from GH&cent;1,011,401 in 2010 to GH&cent;1,361,894 in 2011, showing an  increase of 35%.</p>
        <p class="style10"><strong><u>DIVIDEND</u></strong><br>
          The  Directors recommend the payment of GH&cent;0.03 per share.&nbsp; With the total number of shares at 1,976,600,  total dividends payment is projected to be GH&cent;59,298.&nbsp; This is an indication of better returns on shareholders  investment, and shareholders are invited to purchase more shares to help raise  the stated capital of the bank.</p>
        <p class="style10"><strong><u>EDUCATION</u></strong><br>
          The  bank continues to award scholarships to needy but brilliant shareholders&rsquo;  wards, and every year, five students are awarded.<br>
      Advertisement  will soon be made for interviews and examination early next year to select  candidates for the awards.&nbsp; The bank has  also sponsored a number of its staff to pursue programs in various Universities.&nbsp; As at today two Management staff have  completed their Masters degree programs with over ten members of staff having  completed first degree programs and a similar number with diploma  certificates.&nbsp; It is our hope that all  these workers would remain in the bank to contribute their quota to the  development of the bank.</p>
        <p class="style10"><strong><u>SEFWI  BEKWAI BUILDING PROJECT</u></strong><br>
          Fellow  shareholders, the Sefwi Bekwai Office building which started a little over a  year ago is about 95% completed.&nbsp; It is  expected to be ready for use at the beginning of next year.&nbsp; Movement to the new office building will help  ease the congestion at the current office.</p>
        <p class="style10"><strong><u>GHANA  CLUB 100 AWARDS (2011 EDITION)</u></strong><br>
  &nbsp;Ladies and Gentlemen the bank again made it to  the Ghana Club 100 for the third time in 2011 rankings, moving from 56th  position in 2009 to the 42nd position in 2010 and to the 36th  position in 2011.<br>
          We  once again dedicate this Award to the honour of the board, Shareholders,  Management and Staff, and all stakeholders and hope that with the support of  everybody, we can move further up the ladder in 2012.</p>
        <p class="style10"><strong><u>RETIREMENT</u></strong><br>
          The  following Directors are due to retire by rotation this year, and they are  eligible for re-election.&nbsp; They have  expressed the desire to contest for another term, and we count on you to give  them your mandate so that they bring their experience to bear on the progress  of the bank. They are:&nbsp; 1. Mr. Anthony  Donkor and<br>
          2.  Kwame Amankwaah.</p>
        <p class="style10"><strong><u>CONCLUTION</u></strong><br>
          I  am very grateful to the Board, Management and Staff, Shareholders and our  cherished customers for your continued support encouragement and commitment to  the progress of the Bank.<br>
          We  pray that you will continue to support us so that together we can&nbsp; move the bank foreword. <br>
          Thank  you and may God bless us all.</p>
